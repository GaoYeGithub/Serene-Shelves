Inspiration
The inspiration for Serene Shelves came from hope to fight a rising trend of stress and anxiety. Especially in today's fast-paced world, finding time and space to relax and recharge is becoming increasingly difficult. So I wanted to I wanted to create a digital sanctuary where people could find peace and tranquility without leaving their homes. The idea was to combine various therapeutic elements into one comprehensive platform to cater to different needs and preferences.

What it does
Combine various therapeutic elements into one comprehensive platform to cater to different needs and preferences. With 3D room, Ai Chatbots, Journaling, Realtime doodle sessions, and piano room

How we built it
We brainstormed and outlined the features that would be most beneficial for users, deciding on a 3D room, therapist chatbot, journaling, real-time database draw room, and a music room.

Challenges we ran into
Databases was a huge pain with things randomly breaking I hope the demo you see won't break!

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Successfully(almost) integrating diverse technologies to create a cohesive and functional platform was a major achievement.

What we learned
Improved skills in web development, 3D modeling, AI integration, real-time databases, and user experience design. As well as the value of collaboration and the importance of iterative design and testing to refine the product. (So many bugs ðŸ˜­)

What's next for Serene Shelves
Develop a mobile version of Serene Shelves to make it more accessible. Something one of my teammates try to do in react native but suffer setbacks due to time constricts.
